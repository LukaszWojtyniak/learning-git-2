                <p>Near to Banbridge Town, in the County Down<br>
                    One morning last July,<br>
                    Down a boreen green came a sweet colleen,<br>
                    And she smiled as she passed me by;<br>
                    Well, she looked so sweet from her two bare feet<br>
                    To the sheen of her nut-brown hair;<br>
                    Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself<br>
                    To make sure I was really there.
                </p>

                <p>From Bantry Bay up to Derry Quay,<br>
                    And from Galway to Dublin town,<br>
                    No maid I've seen like the sweet colleen<br>
                    That I met in the County Down.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="stanza">
                <p>As she onward sped, sure I shook my head<br>
                    And I looked with a feeling rare.<br>
                    Then I said, says I, to a passer-by,<br>
                    "Who's the maid with the nut-brown hair?"<br>
                    Well, he smiled at me, and with pride says he,<br>
                    "That's the gem of old Ireland's crown,<br>
                    She's young Rosie McCann from the banks of the Bann,<br>
                    She's the Star of the County Down."</p>
